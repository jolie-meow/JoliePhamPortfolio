# JoliePhamPortfolio
Portfolio that consists of my personal data analysis / data science projects

# Project 1: City	of	Melbourne
* The	aim	is	to	find	out	which	suburb	is	the	most	liveable	in	City	of	Melbourne,	based	on	property	prices,	facilities	and	overall	safety	perceptions.
* Located	and	merged data	from	3	different	sources and	tidied	the	data using	`R` and	`Tidyverse`.
* Scanned	for	and	dealt	with all	missing	values,	inconsistencies	and	outliers.
* Transformed	data for	better	understanding	and	help decreasing the	skewness	in	distribution.
* Visualised	and	communicated	the	results	with	`ggplot2`

# Project 2: Spam	Detection 
* The	aim	is	to	classify	text	messages (sms) as	either spam	or	ham,	based	on	the	content
* Prepared	and	cleaned	raw	data,	conducted	EDA	in	`Python` using	`Pandas` and `Matplotlib` to	form	an	interpretation	of	data.
* *Tokenised*	the	spam/ham	sms	by	words	using	`CountVectorizer`.
* Trained	and	evaluated	*KNN* and	*Decision Tree* using	`SMOTE`

# Project 3: Employee	Turnover	Analysis 
* The	aim is	to	create	a	model	that	can	predict	groups	of	employees	that have	a	high	tendency	of	leaving	company.
* Explored	the	data	and	relationships	using	descriptive	analytics	and	graphs	using	`Python`.
* Transformed,	normalised	data	to	prepare	for	training	models,	using	*K-Means* and	*DBSCAN*
* Tested	models	and	evaluated	*clustering*	performance.

# Project 4: Recommendation	 Engine	 Algorithms	 Evaluation 
* The	 aim	 is to	 evaluate the	 companyâ€™s new	recommendation	engine	algorithm	is	worth	rolling	to	all	customers.
* Performed *hypothesis	testing* to	calculate	the	significance	of	key	results on	samples.
* Identify	trends	by	performing	linear	and	multiple	*regression	analysis*.
* Created	visualisations	to	support	communication using	`ggplot2` and	`plotly` packages in	`R`.
* Provided	recommendations	for	future	data	collection	and	investigation	to	minimise	bias	and	errors.
